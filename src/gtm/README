Global Transaction Manager (GTM)
--------------------------------

1. Source code layout:
----------------------

The server side code is located in the "include", "common" and
"main" directories. The "include" directory hosts all the header
files some of which are also shared by the client.

The "common" directory contains the infrastructure pieces for the
server such as error reporting, memory management, locking etc.
Most of the server side logic including message processing,
transaction management, thread and connection management is hosted
in the "main" directory.

The client side code is put in the "client" directory including all
client side infrastructure and test programs.


2. Building GTM Server and Clients:
-----------------------------------

Go to the top level directory (where this README is located) and run
the make command to build the sources.

$ make

This would build the GTM server in the "main" directory and client
libraries in the "client" directory.

You may want to change the following two defines in main/main.c 

#define GTM_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME    "localhost"
#define GTM_DEFAULT_PORT        6666


3. Running the GTM Server:
---------------------------

You can run the GTM server by running the following command from the
top level directory.

$ ./main/gtm

The server will start listening on port 6666 for incoming connections.


4. Building test clients:
-------------------------

Go to the "client/test" directory and run make to build the test clients.

$ cd client/test
$ make

This would build various test clients, statically linking to the libgtmclient.a
library in the client directory. You may need to change the connect string
appropriately connect to the GTM server.
